# Fractal-Geometry

This repository contains python codes to numerous commonly studied fractals that are of importance in Non Linear Dynamics in addition to their
niche applications in climate modeling, population dynamics etc. Some of these have been simulated using the tkinter package in Python 3.8
Various rules of Cellular Automata theory have been used (The specific rule use has been commented in the oython scipt)

Of primary utility was the rule 30 of cellular automata. This rule is of particular interest because it produces complex, seemingly random patterns 
from simple, well-defined rules. Rule 30 has also been classified as a proponent of the 'stream cypher' , noteworthy for cyptography. 

This is more of an exploratory repository, meant to dump codes that help us appreciate patterns around us that seem arcane at first, but are of great
fascination, not just to the human eye, but also to various branches of physics and engineering.

P.S : Next time you take coffee at Starbucks, don't forget to observe the brachistochrone on top !
